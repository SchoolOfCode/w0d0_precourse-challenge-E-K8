## My tribute page is about David Flanagan - the author of many books on JavaScript and Java

## What and Why
> I wanted my project to be IT-related.
>
> I went with the first idea that came to me after a saw a book on JavaScript. 
>
>I thought - why not make a tribute page about the author? No reason not to.

## Take-aways
>  I wanted to practice flexbox, so I added a few pictures of the books to play with.

>  Also I learnt a bit more about hover effects, in particular `transform: translate3d();`, I used it to style the arrow at the bottom that takes the user to the top.

>  Colour-wise, I based my choice on the colour I saw on some of the books' covers.

>  It took me a while to understand how to run tests on the page from VSCode, but I found the solution on [freecodecamp forum](https://forum.freecodecamp.org/t/testing-code-using-cdn-link-in-visual-studio-code/206501).

> I discovered that the Slack chats can be useful even when I am not in search for a particular answer.
> I was reading advice on file tree structure, checked mine and saw that it wasn't good. I fixed that - and miraculously,
> Live Server started updating my page again (I had to refresh it manually and it was annoying because I couldn't understand why it suddenly stopped working).
